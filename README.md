# Feed-Forward-Neural-network-on-Cifar-dataset
Training and implementing a feed forward neural network to classify Cifar dataset.

This project is centered around the objective of addressing data gaps within a dataset through predictive techniques harnessed from the scikit-learn library. To achieve this goal, the project unfolds through distinct stages.

Initially, the focus lies on resolving the issue of missing values. Multiple methodologies are employed to fill the voids in the dataset. One notable technique involves populating the empty cells with the mean value derived from other existing numbers within the same column. Subsequently, a comprehensive evaluation and discussion of these diverse methods take place.

The subsequent phase involves harnessing the capabilities of the scikit-learn library. The primary aim is to pinpoint an optimal model within the library, capable of effectively predicting values for our dataset. This entails identifying and utilizing a specific function within the library. This model-centric approach focuses on estimating the target column while leveraging one of the features present in the .csv file.

Moreover, an integral facet of this project involves a meticulous analysis of the features found within the .csv file. This analysis serves to ascertain which feature holds the most pertinent potential as a predictor. The specific objective here is to predict movie genres, and thus, identifying the most influential feature for accurate genre predictions is paramount.

In summation, the overarching aim of this project is to resolve dataset gaps through predictive methodologies provided by the scikit-learn library. The project comprises phases such as diverse imputation methods, model selection, and identifying the optimal feature for predicting movie genres. This comprehensive approach enhances data completeness and augments informed genre predictions.
